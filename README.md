# Simple Calculator in C

This project is part of **Week 1 - C Skill Up Course** on GeeksforGeeks.  
It is a simple calculator program written in C that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


## Features
- Takes two numbers as input
- Performs:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (with zero-check)
- Allows multiple calculations using a loop
- Handles invalid input safely


## Concepts Used
This project demonstrates the use of:
- `printf()` and `scanf()` for input/output  
- Variables and data types (`float`, `int`)  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)  
- Looping (`do-while` loop)


## Code Information
The calculator continues running until the user chooses to exit.  
If division by zero is attempted, the program displays an error message.


## Acknowledgement
This program was written as part of my C learning journey.  
Some improvements (like input validation) were added with help from a friend to make it more robust.
